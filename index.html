Oh, Its Just A Place That I Built To Share A Few Things About Myself And What I Like Doing. Kinda Like A Portfolio But More Of A Biography. Now I Don't Know How Ya Got Here, Probably Via The Link In My Discord ABOUT ME Section. But Thanks For Taking A Peek! You Like The Design? I've Spent Hours Trying To Think Of A Plausible Look While Keeping The UI As Simple As Possible.<br><br>

I Wanted To Know How They Created It And Soon Found Out That They Have Been Using What's Known As A <b>DAW</b> (Digital Audio Workstation). But I Didn't Have A Computer, So All My Hopes Of Making My Own Music Was Gone. But It Was Until That I Found Out That There Was A Mobile Version Of <b>FL Studio</b>. I Was Shocked And Did The One And Only Thing Which Is Installing It! I Quickly Picked Up The Workflow Of The App And Soon Started Making My Own Beats. Up To This Day, I Still Use FL Studio Mobile As My Primary DAW And Hoping That Someday I Will Move On To A More Powerful One Which Will Open Up More Doors In My Music Making Skills.</h2>
